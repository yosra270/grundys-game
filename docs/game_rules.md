Game's rules package defines the rules of the game :
    - What defines the game :
        - Its state : how many heaps are in the current turn + how coins in each heap.
        - The current player : whose turn it is to play now.
    - What are the possible actions a player can choose + what is the next action among them.
    - When is the game over + who won it.
